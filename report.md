## Summary
This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern DevOps pipeline for deploying a containerized web application on AWS cloud infrastructure. The solution integrates Infrastructure as Code (IaC), configuration management, and containerization technologies to create a robust, automated deployment process.

## Introduction
### Objectives
- Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Configure server environments using Ansible
- Deploy containerized applications using Docker
- Create an automated deployment pipeline
- Ensure security best practices throughout the infrastructure

### Tools Used
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Cloud Provider:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
- **Web Server:** Nginx

## Infrastructure Setup
### Terraform Configuration
The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform with the following key components:

```hcl
# Key Infrastructure Components:
- AWS EC2 Instance (t3.micro)
- Security Groups
  - Inbound: SSH (22), HTTP (80)
  - Outbound: All traffic
- SSH Key Pair for secure access
- Region: eu-north-1
```

### Architecture Diagram

## Configuration Management
### Ansible Setup
Ansible playbooks handle server configuration and application deployment:

Key configurations:
- Docker installation and configuration
- User permissions management
- Application deployment
- Container management

```yaml
# Key Ansible Tasks:
- Docker installation
- User configuration
- Application deployment
- Container orchestration
```

## Docker Container Deployment
### Container Configuration
The application is containerized using Docker with Nginx as the web server:

```dockerfile
# Key Dockerfile Components:
- Base Image: nginx:alpine
- Application files
- Port configuration
- Security considerations
```

### Deployment Process
1. Image building
2. Container creation
3. Port mapping
4. Health checks

## CI/CD Pipeline
[This section can be expanded based on your GitHub Actions implementation]

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. SSH Key Management
**Challenge:** Initial SSH key configuration issues  
**Solution:** Generated dedicated key pair with proper permissions and implemented secure key management practices

### 2. Distribution Compatibility
**Challenge:** Switching between different Linux distributions  
**Solution:** Adapted Ansible playbooks to use appropriate package managers and commands for Ubuntu

### 3. Infrastructure State Management
**Challenge:** Terraform state lock issues  
**Solution:** Implemented proper state management practices and error handling

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a modern DevOps pipeline, showcasing:
- Automated infrastructure provisioning
- Consistent configuration management
- Containerized application deployment
- Secure access management
